# Explains

## Pytest
1. **Parametrize:** useful to run same tests with different set of values to run multiple cases. Go to `explains/27_pytest_parametrize.py` module.
2. **Testing exceptions:** used when need to test that source code raises a specific exception type. Also includes testing the output (exception args). Go to `explains/176_pytest_exceptions.py` module.

## Cache
1. **@functools.lru_cache decorator:** You can cache the results of a function and play with the cache size according to the needs. Go to `explains/54_functools_lru_cache.py` module.
